Fucka never loved us
"Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do"
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
That's been where you find me at
"Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait"
"Skrrt skrrt, oh"
If you ain’t running games

"This a ""doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge"" song"
Hate when they get too attached to me

"Ever since I left the city, you"
"If I die, I'm a legend"
"Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?"

Say my name
"And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it"
It's yours
To see who really with you

Did y'all boys not get the memo?
Its supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me

"Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya"
I got the drink in me going back to back
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
That can only mean one thing
Never let these niggas ride your wave
May your neighbors respect you
"Started from the bottom, now we're here"
"Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that"
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
But we still met later that night
